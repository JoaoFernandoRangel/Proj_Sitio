Thrugh this project I intend to build a remote control for far away rural property that has access to internet. 
For this early build I'm establishing a connection through a MQTT Broker(HiveMQ) and sending commands between GPIO's of two ESP32. 
The finished product will use this connection to send commands to far away equipment through a Lora Network.
